# Hybrid Recommendation System

I developed a **hybrid recommendation system** that combines multiple approaches to deliver highly accurate and personalized recommendations. 

### Techniques Used:
1. **Apriori Algorithm**:
   - To extract association rules and understand purchase patterns.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - **User-based filtering**: Recommendations based on similar user preferences.
   - **Item-based filtering**: Recommendations based on item similarities.
3. **Content-based Filtering**:
   - Leveraging item attributes for tailored recommendations.
4. **Time and Weighted-based Methods**:
   - Incorporated temporal dynamics and weights to enhance recommendation accuracy.

### Dataset
The system was trained and tested using the **Online Retail Final** dataset. The dataset includes transaction details, making it perfect for e-commerce recommendation systems.
